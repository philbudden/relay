# Samba service configuration for relay_services group
# Override default values here or use Ansible Vault for secrets

# Uncomment and customize as needed:

# samba_workgroup: "HOMELAB"
# samba_server_string: "My NAS"
# samba_timezone: "America/New_York"

# Example: Custom shares
# samba_shares:
#   - name: "media"
#     path: "/mnt/ssd/shares/media"
#     browseable: "yes"
#     readonly: "no"
#     guest: "no"
#     users: "alice,bob"
#     comment: "Media Library"
#   - name: "documents"
#     path: "/mnt/ssd/shares/documents"
#     browseable: "yes"
#     readonly: "no"
#     guest: "no"
#     users: "alice"
#     comment: "Personal Documents"
#   - name: "backups"
#     path: "/mnt/backup/shares"
#     browseable: "yes"
#     readonly: "yes"
#     guest: "no"
#     users: "alice,bob"
#     comment: "Backup Storage (Read-Only)"

# SECURITY: Use Ansible Vault for passwords!
# Create: ansible-vault create inventory/group_vars/relay_services/vault.yml
# Edit: ansible-vault edit inventory/group_vars/relay_services/vault.yml
#
# Then reference in users:
# samba_users:
#   - username: "alice"
#     password: "{{ vault_alice_samba_password }}"
#     uid: 1000
#     gid: 1000
#   - username: "bob"
#     password: "{{ vault_bob_samba_password }}"
#     uid: 1001
#     gid: 1001
#
# NOTE: Passwords are REQUIRED. Empty passwords will cause deployment to fail.
